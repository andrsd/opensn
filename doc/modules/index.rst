Modules
=======

Modules are intended to be code segments that perform unique operations and
functions. In general, the math, mesh and other utilities should serve
most of the needs of the modules and where appropriate functionalities of
some modules can eventually be incorporated into the utilities category.

An additional function of modules is to allow us to segregate open source
modules from export controlled or classified software.
