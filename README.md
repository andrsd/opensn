# OpenSn #

OpenSn is a large-scale scientific simulation engine being developed at
Texas A&M University as part of a research study on massively parallel
algorithms for modeling and simulation. The main physics modules
of OpenSn deal with solving the linear Boltzmann equation and
diffusion-reaction physics.
