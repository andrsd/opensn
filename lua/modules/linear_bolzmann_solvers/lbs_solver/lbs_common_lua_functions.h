 *
 * ###Note on the Eager limit
 * The eager limit is the message size limit before which non-blocking MPI send
 * calls will execute without waiting for a matching receive call. The limit is
 * platform dependent but in general 64 kb. Some systems have 32 kb as a limit
 * and therefore we use that as a default limit in ChiTech. There is a fine
 * interplay between message size and the shear amount of messages that will be
 * sent. In general smaller messages tend to be more efficient, however, when
 * there are too many small messages being sent around the communication system
 * on the given platform will start to suffer. One can gain a small amount of
 * parallel efficiency by lowering this limit, however, there is a point where
 * the parallel efficiency will actually get worse so use with caution.

 *
 * ### Notes on selecting iterative methods
 * The iterative methods NPT_CLASSICRICHARDSON, NPT_CLASSICRICHARDSON_CYCLES,
 * NPT_GMRES and NPT_GMRES_CYCLES are considered legacy. The NPT_GMRES and
 * NPT_GMRES_CYCLES are now considered deprecated with the inclusion of the
 * generalized Krylov iteration method-class (which supports all the options
 * prepended with KRYLOV_).
 *
 * RICHARDSON is probably the least memory consuming but has the poorest
 * convergence rate.
 *
 * GMRES generally has the best convergence rate but it builds a basis
 * comprising multiple solutions vectors, the amount of which is controlled via
 * the gmres-restart parameter, which can dramatically increase memory consumption.
 * GMRES restarts, i.e. the amount of iterations before the basis is destroyed and
 * restarted, influences both memory consumptions and convergence behavior, e.g.,
 * lower restart numbers generally lowers memory consumption but increases the
 * amount of iteration required to convergence.
 *
 * The required memory and the computational time for one iteration with BiCGStab
 * is constant, i.e., the time and memory requirements do not increase with the
 * number of iterations as they do for restarted GMRES. BiCGStab uses approximately
 * the same amount of memory as GMRES uses for two iterations. Therefore, BiCGStab
 * typically uses less memory than GMRES. The convergence behavior of BiCGStab is
 * often more irregular than that of GMRES. Intermediate residuals can even be
 * orders of magnitude larger than the initial residual, which can affect the
 * numerical accuracy as well as the rate of convergence. If the algorithm detects
 * poor accuracy in the residual or the risk of stagnation, it restarts the
 * iterations with the current solution as the initial guess. In contrast to GMRES,
 * BiCGStab uses two matrix-vector multiplications each iteration (requiring two
 * transport sweeps). Also, when using the left-preconditioned BiCGStab, an
 * additional preconditioning step is required each iteration. That is,
 * left-preconditioned BiCGStab requires a total of three preconditioning steps in
 * each iteration. We generally apply Within-group Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration
 * (WGDSA) and Two-Grid Acceleration (TGDSA) as left-preconditioners and therefore
 * the total cost of these pre-conditioners will increase when using BiCGStab. Use
 * BiCGStab when you are running problem with a high scattering order (i.e., L is
 * large) because this will dramatically increase the GMRES basis.
